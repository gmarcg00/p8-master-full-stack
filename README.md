# Project Documentation

Welcome to our project! This document will guide you on how to understand and use the API, as well as the structure of the database that underpins our application.

## 📄 API Documentation

To explore and understand the available API endpoints, refer to our comprehensive documentation located in the `swagger.yml` file. This file provides detailed information about each endpoint, including:

- **Request Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **Parameters**: Query and body parameters.
- **Responses**: Status codes and example responses.

### How to Use
You can import `swagger.yml` into tools like [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to get a visual representation of the API and even test the endpoints directly.

## 🗃️ Database Structure

Our database schema and sample data are defined in the `db.sql` file. This file is essential for understanding the relationships between tables and the data structure we use.

### What’s Inside?
- **Table Definitions**: Complete table structures with data types and constraints.
- **Sample Data**: Initial data inserts to quickly set up the environment.
